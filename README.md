# clustering_customers
clustering task


The objective is to cluster customers based on features such as gender, age, income, annual spending score.
I performed some EDA first. Then I applied K-means using both the elbow method and the silhoutte coefficient to evaluate the best number of clusters.
I also applied hierarchical clustering using different linkage criteria.
After I identified the best number of clusters I performed some analysis for each cluster to understand the different clusters better.

I finally provided some recommendations in terms of the best clusters and thus customers on which the mall should focus on.

The dataset was taken from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python
